3D design for Hatobot mobile robot. This mobile robot operates in an indoor environment and sees its surroundings using the built-in camera. People can interact with this robot by throwing the 'bird food', and this robot can perform a 'pecking position' on the food. When the battery is already low, it can search and go back to the charging station.
